<h2>Prototype Tips and Tutorials</h2>
  <div id="lexcerpt"></div>
  <div id="abody"><p>Welcome to the Learn section!</p>

<p>This area contains <strong>narrative documentation</strong> you can use to discover Prototype, acquire skills in specific feature areas, etc.</p>

<p>It is mostly articles and tutorials. You might also want to <a href="http://prototypejs.org/blog">check out the blog</a> for quick-bite examples. New docs in this section should happen fairly often.</p>

<p>If you are looking for <em>reference documentation</em>, hop over to the <a href="../api.prototypejs.org/index.html">API Docs</a>!</p></div>
   <ul id="learn-articles">
   
   
    
   
    <li>
      <h3><a href="learn/introduction-to-ajax.html">Introduction to Ajax</a></h3>
      <div class="llmeta"><p>Prototype framework enables you to deal with Ajax calls in a very easy and fun way that is also safe (cross-browser). Besides simple requests, this module also deals in a smart way with JavaScript code returned from a server and provides helper classes for polling.</p></div>
    </li>
    
    
   
    <li>
      <h3><a href="learn/extensions.html">How Prototype extends the DOM</a></h3>
      <div class="llmeta"><p>The biggest part of the Prototype framework are its DOM extensions. Prototype adds many convenience methods to elements returned by the <code>$()</code> function: for instance, you can write <code>$('comments').addClassName('active').show()</code> to get the element with the ID 'comments', add a class name to it and show it (if it was previously hidden). The 'comments' element didn't have those methods in native JavaScript; how is this possible? This document reveals some clever hacks found in Prototype.</p></div>
    </li>
    
    
   
    <li>
      <h3><a href="learn/json.html">Introduction to JSON</a></h3>
      <div class="llmeta"><p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format (if you are new to JSON, you can read more about it on the <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON website</a>). It is notably used by APIs all over the web and is a fast alternative to XML in Ajax requests. Prototype 1.5.1 finally features JSON encoding and parsing support.</p></div>
    </li>
    
    
   
    <li>
      <h3><a href="learn/class-inheritance.html">Defining classes and inheritance</a></h3>
      <div class="llmeta"><p>In the early versions of Prototype, the framework came with basic support for
class creation: the <a href="http://prototypejs.org/api/class/create"><code>Class.create()</code></a> method. Until now the
<em>only</em> feature of classes defined this way was that the constructor called a
method called <code>initialize</code> automatically. <strong>Prototype 1.6.0</strong> now comes with
inheritance support through the <code>Class</code> module, which has taken several steps
further since the last version; you can make richer classes in your code with
more ease than before.</p></div>
    </li>
    
    
   
    <li>
      <h3><a href="learn/contribute.html">Contribute</a></h3>
      <div class="llmeta"><p>Think you found a bug? Got some handy code you think would fit awesomely in the framework? Or do you have what it takes to optimize some important method &mdash; or even a whole module &mdash; making it more flexible, powerful or speedy? Then prove your JavaScript-fu by contributing to Prototype!</p>

<p>We welcome any (and all!) of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>bug reports;</li>
<li>failing tests proving some feature is broken in certain cases;</li>
<li>code patches;</li>
<li>enhancement requests and patches;</li>
<li>additional tests for code that you believe hasn't got enough coverage;</li>
<li>API documentation contributions;</li>
<li>ideas and other interesting discussions on the mailing lists or in the IRC channel.</li>
</ul></div>
    </li>
    
    
   
    <li>
      <h3><a href="learn/upgrading.html">Upgrading to the latest stable release</a></h3>
      <div class="llmeta"><p>If you&#8217;ve put off the task of upgrading your old code to the latest stable release of Prototype, now you&#8217;re out of excuses. Since version 1.6, Prototype comes with with an <a href="assets/2008/4/22/prototype_update_helper.js">update helper</a> that will warn you of any deprecations or API changes.</p></div>
    </li>
    
    
  </ul>
